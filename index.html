<h1> My first website launch!</h1>
<h2> A first html webpage creation experience</h2>
<p1>
    <text-size:60px>Crating a web page isn´t as difficult as people realize but, you need time to do it and at the same time you need to, think the main topic of your web page.</text-size:60px>
</p1><br>
<b><text-size:60px>How difficult is to create a web page?</text-size:60px>
</b><br>
<p2> Well, it´s not difficult to create a web page in the internet you only need to have a little knowladge of programming text 
because, you´re going to need <u>html text to create a web page.</u></p2><br>
<img src="exploring.png" style="width:700px; height:375px;"><br>
<p3> Web page language is an extend topic that we can share with you, we know that maybe if you want to create your fist html page, it can be to practice, to learn how to do it
    or it may be for a product sell, <u>we are going to show you an experience of creating a web page not how to do a selling page for public, keep that in mind!</u>
</p3>

<h2> Are there any steps I need to follow to create my own web page?
</h2>
<p4> A lot of people want an answer to this question and this is one of the questions that I can say that <b>"no"</b>, a web page is your own style so you decide how it will be
    you only have to keep in mind that your page is going to be probably visit by a lot of people from different countries so you need to make different kind of ideas
    so people from different parts of the world will understand better what you want to tell them, <i>most of the time people like to have different content sections</i>, so 
    that means that you need to decide if your web page is going to be a simple page or a complex page, and whit this you´re going to start programming and you will
    start to make a structure of your page and design all the things it will have in the near future for your new community, <b>I will help you but I´m not going to give you
    a lot of ideas because, I might brake your dreams and opinions</b> and it isn´t the point, <b><u>remember that we are a community and the point is that you all learn new things.</u></b><br>

<h2>How I fell doing this web page?</h2>
<p2> Well I fell really good doing it and I beging doing it because I have different ideas that I prefer to share with other than with my own🤠</p2><br>
<hr>
<h2> And now let´s talk about that experience of robotics but, don´t worry I´ll share how to create a webpage in an other blog only of that!👾🤖</h2><br>
<hr>
<h1>How is going to competitions?</h1>
<p4>You need to be really concentrated and you might fo to different places to practice before the competition because, in this way it will be better to have
    this kind of things in your hand to do the this better in the next competitions but, you need to have in mind that when you do this kind of things you are in 
    a new world and you won´t be able to forget this experiences and this will be new things that you´re going to do in your life in order to crate new things.
</p4>
<p2> For some people this might be easy or difficult but, I recommend to take it in the relax way because if not this won´t be possible, I try to do it before in
    other way and it doesn´t work🤕 </p2><br>
